# Resonance Music Editor handoff

Updated: 2026-08-08

Repository: <https://github.com/tilok1234/resonance-music-editor>

## Takeover summary

Resonance is a clean-room restart of a Windows game-music editor. The current application is a working single-track technical foundation, not a complete DAW. It loads one explicitly scanned and inventory-approved Surge XT 1.3.4 VST3, plays through Windows Audio/WASAPI, edits one looping MIDI clip in a piano roll, opens the native Surge editor with audition controls, and saves an explicitly accepted named instrument state with the symbolic song.

The working tree contains the accepted M4 snapshot-first sound workflow. It captures live Surge state as ephemeral B, auditions project A and candidate B through the same instance, applies B as one dirty Undo transaction, restores live sound state on Undo/Redo, and saves only the accepted project snapshot. The held-note scheduler defect is fixed and user-confirmed. The user preferred B as less annoying and passed Apply, dirty marker, Undo, Redo, Save, Close, and Open. Final recapture exposed lifecycle-dependent opaque Surge encodings for the same restored sound; the repaired packaged native workflow reopens and plays the exact saved B, captures unchanged B with matching `91ED214E` identities, rejects it, stays clean, and closes without a false warning. The user explicitly accepted M4 at 2026-08-08 23:54 +02:00. M5 is next but has not started.

The last published code baseline when this handoff was written was `176bc78` (`Update validation assertion count`) on `main`. Always verify live `HEAD`, upstream state, and the working tree before relying on that value. The existence of this handoff does not prove that a documentation change has already been committed or pushed.

Project version: `0.3.0` (accepted M4 host-owned sound workflow)

## Product direction

The goal is a music-only editor aimed primarily at video games. It should eventually support fluid and smooth, fast and aggressive, slow and calm, and intermediate musical styles. Manual and AI-assisted editing must share one project model. General sound-effect creation is outside scope.

Read [the product vision](docs/PRODUCT_VISION.md) before changing product scope.

## Implemented capabilities

- JUCE 9 / C++20 / CMake Windows-native application.
- VST3-first hosting with Surge XT as the first accepted instrument.
- Disposable one-bundle scanner child.
- Parent-owned deadline, quarantine, and accepted inventory.
- Exact VST3 bundle fingerprint revalidation before interactive load.
- Explicit Windows Audio/WASAPI device selector.
- Sample-accurate looping MIDI scheduler.
- Mouse and hardware MIDI input.
- Play/Pause, Stop/Rewind, Panic, master gain, meters, and diagnostics.
- Native Surge window with Resonance audition transport and keyboard.
- One editable piano-roll clip with add, move, resize, delete, velocity, snap, and loop length.
- Gesture-level Undo/Redo for project edits.
- Versioned `.resonance.json` project with 960 PPQ and stable note IDs.
- Base64 VST3 state plus SHA-256 integrity.
- Candidate-then-replace project opening and exact state restore.
- Host-owned named A/project and ephemeral B/candidate sound snapshots.
- Explicit Capture B, Audition A/B, Apply B, and Reject B controls.
- One-transaction sound Apply with live-state Undo/Redo restoration.
- Save isolation: unapplied previews never silently replace the accepted project sound.
- Separate exact saved-state integrity from the live-equivalent hash observed after Surge restore.
- Silent packaged self-test, UI snapshot mode, and idle CPU regression mode.

Device name, sample rate, block size, latency, full path-derived identifier, and bundle fingerprint are machine observations. Regenerate rather than copying them to another machine.

## Durable architecture decisions

1. VST3 is a foundation, not a later adapter: [ADR-0001](docs/ADR-0001-vst3-host-foundation.md).
2. Unknown discovery runs outside the editor: [ADR-0002](docs/ADR-0002-crash-isolated-plugin-scanning.md).
3. The first real-time path is one explicit WASAPI instrument: [ADR-0003](docs/ADR-0003-realtime-audio-engine.md).
4. The first sound workflow uses named host-owned opaque snapshots, not direct `.fxp` indexing: [ADR-0004](docs/ADR-0004-host-owned-sound-snapshots.md).
5. The mutable `SongProject` never crosses into the audio callback; it publishes fixed-capacity immutable snapshots.
6. Saved project state is versioned symbolic data plus opaque VST3 state, never bundled plug-in code.
7. Project open is fail-closed and transactional at the active-model boundary.
8. Technical acceptance and user listening approval are separate gates.

Read [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [VST3 hosting](docs/VST3_HOSTING.md) before implementation.

## Real-time invariants

Do not introduce file I/O, UI work, scanning, plug-in editor creation, unbounded allocation, or waits on message-thread locks in the audio callback. Process exactly the device-requested sample count. Keep automated self-test silent. Keep transport stopped and master gain at `-12 dB` on startup. Do not poll VST3 `hasEditor()` or similar capability methods from paint or timer paths.

The two regressions most worth remembering are:

- Surge fast-failed when the host passed the 4,096-sample backing capacity instead of the device's 441 requested samples.
- The UI appeared frozen when a 30 Hz timer repeatedly called JUCE VST3 `hasEditor()`, which constructed and released a native view.

Both paths are now covered by packaged acceptance modes.

## Known limitations

- Exactly one instrument track and one looping clip.
- Exactly one accepted current VST3 instrument is selected from inventory.
- No factory-preset file browser or semantic parameter browser; the first host-owned workflow selects named captured snapshots only.
- Arbitrary native Surge edits remain preview state until explicit Capture B and Apply B; they do not mark the project dirty immediately. New, Open, and Close perform a one-time comparison and warn if live state matches neither A nor B.
- Only the accepted A snapshot is persisted. The ephemeral B candidate is intentionally not stored across application restarts.
- No multiple tracks, mixer, pan, mute, solo, buses, or effects chain.
- No arrangement timeline, sections, tempo changes, or automation lanes.
- No AI command system or connected AI service.
- No game-state transitions, stem management, offline final-song export, or engine adapter.
- Scanner isolation does not contain a failure from a VST3 already processing in the editor.
- The build script currently assumes the Visual Studio 18 Community installation and generator.
- JUCE licensing for public/commercial binary distribution remains unresolved.

## Recommended next gate

Begin [Roadmap M5: Unified edit-command layer](docs/ROADMAP.md#m5-unified-edit-command-layer) as a separate scope. Start with the versioned command contract, revision/hash preconditions, candidate-project preview, and Apply/Reject boundaries in [the AI editing design](docs/AI_EDITING_DESIGN.md). Do not combine that slice with `.fxp` indexing, multi-track, arrangement, or live model-service integration.

## First takeover actions

From the repository root:

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -5
python .\scripts\check-docs.py
```

Then:

1. read `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, this handoff, and the relevant ADRs;
2. inspect ignored local dependency, build, inventory, and quarantine state without adding it to Git;
3. run the full Release sequence before modifying a risky boundary, or record why a narrower gate is proportionate;
4. preserve unrelated local edits;
5. inspect ADR-0004 and the accepted M4 diff before changing the sound-workflow contract.

The full commands and prerequisites are in [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) and [Testing and release](docs/TESTING_AND_RELEASE.md).

## Scope boundaries for takeover

- Do not add sound-effect creation to this repository.
- Do not copy an external music catalog, approved render, VST3 binary, preset library, or sample library into the repository without an explicit integration request and license review.
- Do not treat old diagnostic audio as a quality baseline.
- Do not treat tests as listening approval.
- Do not distribute editor binaries until licensing is resolved.
- Do not scan arbitrary installed plug-ins inside the interactive editor.
- Do not publish or rewrite Git history without user authorization.

## Ready-to-paste fresh-task prompt

```text
Take over the local clone of https://github.com/tilok1234/resonance-music-editor.

First read HANDOFF.md and docs/README.md completely, then inspect git status, the current branch/HEAD, recent commits, and the ignored local build/inventory state. Preserve any existing changes and do not publish anything without my approval.

The product is a music-only editor aimed mainly at video-game music. Manual and future AI edits must share one versioned project model, and technical tests must remain separate from listening approval.

M4 is accepted as version 0.3.0. ADR-0004 chose named opaque state snapshots. Manual Capture B, A/B, Apply, dirty marker, Undo, Redo, Save, Close, and Open passed, B was preferred as less annoying, and the packaged live-equivalence retest passes against the exact saved project. The next milestone is M5's unified validated edit-command layer. Keep it separate from factory `.fxp` indexing, multi-track, arrangement, and live AI-service integration.
```

## Handoff maintenance

At the end of the next milestone, update this file with the exact accepted artifact, test counts, current limitations, next slice, and published commit. Keep historical measurements in a new dated checkpoint rather than rewriting old evidence.
